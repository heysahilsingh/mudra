# Mudra Keeper
Introducing Mudra Keeper, an intuitive web application designed to assist users in effortlessly tracking their daily incomes and expenses. With a user-friendly interface, Mudra Keeper simplifies the process of adding and managing financial transactions.

Our vision for Mudra Keeper was inspired by the essence of [MISA MoneyKeeper](https://sothuchi.misa.vn/en/home/) app's user interface, but it's important to note that we have developed it entirely from the ground up, ensuring originality and respecting intellectual property rights.

## Features
- **Transaction Tracking**: Easily add and manage your daily incomes and expenses transactions.
- **Date Picker**: Utilizes the [duDatepicker](https://github.com/dmuy/duDatepicker) library to provide a convenient date picker functionality.
- **Iconography**: Uses [Phosphor Icons](https://github.com/phosphor-icons/homepage) to enhance the visual experience with attractive icons.
- **Data Visualization**: Incorporates [Chart.js](https://github.com/chartjs) to display transaction data in visually appealing charts.
